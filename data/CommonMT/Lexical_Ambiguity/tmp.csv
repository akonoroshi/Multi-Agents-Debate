Affirmative side,"I believe the correct translation is ""The watch on this person's wrist has been running for 3 minutes.""

Firstly, the Chinese text mentions ""表"" which refers to a watch or a clock. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the text is referring to a timepiece.

Secondly, the verb ""走"" in this context means ""to run"" or ""to go"" in the sense of a watch or clock ticking. Therefore, the text is indicating that the watch has been running for a duration of 3 minutes.

Lastly, the phrase ""戴着的"" means ""worn on"" or ""on"" in the sense of something being on one's body. Therefore, the text is specifically referring to the watch that is on the person's wrist.

Overall, the translation ""The watch on this person's wrist has been running for 3 minutes"" accurately conveys the meaning of the Chinese text.

Do you agree with my perspective? Please provide your reasons."
