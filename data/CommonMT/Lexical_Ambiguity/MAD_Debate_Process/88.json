At the end of each round, you will evaluate the candidates' translation submissions based on the following criteria:\n1. Accuracy: The degree to which the translation captures the original meaning of the source text.\n2. Fluency: The readability and naturalness of the translation in English."

In fact, I agree with your interpretation. I believe that \"\u4ed6\u6253\u7b97\u53eb\u56db\u4e2a\u83dc\" can indeed be translated to \"He plans to order four dishes.\" \n\nIn Chinese, \"\u53eb\" can have multiple meanings, such as \"to call\" or \"to shout\", but in this context, it is being used to mean \"to order\" as in \"to request food\" in a restaurant. \n\nTherefore, I fully support your translation that accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have? Present them without reasons."
