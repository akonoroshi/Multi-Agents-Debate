Therefore, it is fitting to translate it as \"banner\" in English.\n\nSecondly, the phrase \"\u5168\u519b\u7684\" (qu\u00e1n j\u016bn de) in Chinese is an adjective phrase that modifies \"\u65d7\u5e1c\" (q\u00ed zh\u00ec), meaning \"of the whole army\". Therefore, it is best to translate it as \"of the entire army\" or \"the entire army's\".\n\nFinally, \"\u4ed6\u5df2\u7ecf\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\" (t\u0101 y\u01d0 j\u012bng ch\u00e9ng w\u00e9i le) in Chinese means \"He has already become\". This reflects the accomplishment and status of the person being referred to.\n\nOverall, the translation \"He has become the banner of the entire army\" effectively captures the meaning of the original text.\n\nNegative side arguing: I respectfully disagree with your proposed translation. In my opinion, a more accurate translation would be \"He has become the symbol of the entire army.\"\n\nWhile \"banner\" is a valid translation of \"\u65d7\u5e1c\" (q\u00ed zh\u00ec), the word \"symbol\" is more commonly used in English to convey the same meaning.\n\nAdditionally, \"\u5168\u519b\u7684\" (qu\u00e1n j\u016bn de) can be translated as \"of the whole army\" or \"the entire army's\", as you suggested. However, I believe that the word \"symbol\" is broad enough to encompass this meaning without needing to include the possessive marker \"the entire army's\".\n\nFinally, \"\u4ed6\u5df2\u7ecf\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\" (t\u0101 y\u01d0 j\u012bng ch\u00e9ng w\u00e9i le) can also be translated as \"He has already become\", which you noted. However, I would like to emphasize that the inclusion of \"already\" is important in this translation, as it reflects the idea that the person being referred to has achieved this status at a relatively young age or in a short amount of time.\n\nIn summary, my proposed translation is \"He has become the symbol of the entire army\", as it captures the essence of the original text in a more accurate and concise manner.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate. If so, please summarize your reasons for supporting affirmative/negative side and give the final translation that you think is correct, and the debate will conclude.

While I understand your reasoning, I still respectfully hold firm on my original translation \"He has become the banner of the entire army\" as it accurately conveys the intended meaning of the Chinese text.\n\nFirstly, while \"symbol\" is a valid translation for \"\u65d7\u5e1c\" (q\u00ed zh\u00ec), \"banner\" better captures the military connotations of the word. In a military context, \"banner\" refers to a flag or other emblem that represents a unit, organization, or cause. Therefore, \"banner\" is more precise and specific in this context.\n\nSecondly, while \"\u5168\u519b\u7684\" (qu\u00e1n j\u016bn de) can be translated as \"of the whole army\" or \"the entire army's\", including the possessive marker \"the entire army's\" adds clarity and specificity to the translation. It emphasizes that this individual is not just any symbol or banner, but specifically one that represents the entire army.\n\nFinally, while including \"already\" in the translation is certainly valid, I believe it is not necessary to convey the intended meaning. The phrase \"\u5df2\u7ecf\" (y\u01d0 j\u012bng) by itself already conveys the sense of the person having achieved this status or accomplishment in a relatively short time.\n\nIn conclusion, while I appreciate your perspective, I stand by my original translation \"He has become the banner of the entire army\" as the best and most accurate translation of the Chinese text.\n\nNegative side arguing: Thank you for your response. While I respect your viewpoint, I must disagree and reassert that my translation \"He has become the symbol of the entire army\" is the more accurate and appropriate one.\n\nFirstly, I agree that \"banner\" can be a valid translation of \"\u65d7\u5e1c\" (q\u00ed zh\u00ec). However, I believe \"symbol\" is more accurate in this context as it is a broader term that encompasses the idea of a banner or emblem that represents a unit, organization or cause. Importantly, \"symbol\" conveys the idea that the person in question has become a representative figure of the entire army, going beyond just a banner or flag.\n\nSecondly, I maintain that including the possessive marker \"the entire army's\" is not necessary, as \"symbol\" alone covers that meaning. \"Symbol\" implies that the person being referred to represents the entire army, without the need to specify it.\n\nLastly, while \"\u5df2\u7ecf\" (y\u01d0 j\u012bng) can convey a sense of achievement in a relatively short time, the inclusion of \"already\" clarifies that the person being referred to has achieved this status at a young age or in a short amount of time.\n\nOverall, I believe my translation \"He has become the symbol of the entire army\" is a more accurate and appropriate translation of the Chinese text than your proposed translation of \"He has become the banner of the entire army\".\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate.

While I appreciate your arguments, I still maintain my opinion that \"He has become the banner of the entire army\" is a more accurate translation.\n\nFirstly, I agree that \"symbol\" can also be a valid translation of \"\u65d7\u5e1c\" (q\u00ed zh\u00ec). However, I believe \"banner\" is a more appropriate choice for a military context. The term \"banner\" has a more specific meaning that refers to a flag or emblem carried by an army, which represents the solidarity and unification of the troops. The term \"symbol\", on the other hand, has a broader meaning that can refer to anything that represents an idea or entity, and is not as specific to a military context.\n\nSecondly, while I agree that \"symbol\" conveys the meaning of the entire army being represented, I still believe it is important to include the possessive marker \"the entire army's\" to fully convey the meaning of the Chinese text. The phrase \"\u5168\u519b\u7684\" (qu\u00e1n j\u016bn de) implies a possessive relationship, meaning that the person being referred to is the banner or symbol held by the entire army, and not by any other group or individual.\n\nLastly, while including \"already\" in the translation adds additional information about the person's age or timeframe of success, I believe it is not necessary to convey the meaning of the original Chinese text. The phrase \"\u5df2\u7ecf\" (y\u01d0 j\u012bng) alone conveys the sense of an accomplishment or attainment, without the need to specify the timeline.\n\nIn summary, I maintain that \"He has become the banner of the entire army\" is a more accurate and appropriate translation of the Chinese text.\n\nNegative side arguing: Thank you for your response. While I appreciate your reasons, I still disagree and uphold my previous standpoint that \"He has become the symbol of the entire army\" is a more appropriate translation.\n\nFirstly, I do not believe that \"banner\" is necessarily a more appropriate term for a military context than \"symbol\". While \"banner\" may be more specific, it is not necessarily a more accurate translation of the Chinese term \"\u65d7\u5e1c\" (q\u00ed zh\u00ec). In addition, it may give the impression that the person being referred to is a physical flag or banner, rather than a representative figure.\n\nSecondly, I still do not think it is necessary to include the possessive marker \"the entire army's\" in the translation. The word \"symbol\" already implies a sense of representation and the idea of standing in for something larger than oneself. The phrase \"\u5168\u519b\u7684\" (qu\u00e1n j\u016bn de) can still be accurately translated as \"of the entire army\" without the need for the extra possessive marker.\n\nFinally, while including \"already\" may not be strictly necessary to convey the meaning of the original Chinese text, I believe it adds a layer of nuance that strengthens the translation. It implies that the person being referred to has accomplished this feat quickly or at a young age, which underscores their exceptional status.\n\nOverall, I maintain my stance that \"He has become the symbol of the entire army\" is a more accurate and appropriate translation of the Chinese text, as it conveys the significance and representative nature of the person being referred to.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate.
