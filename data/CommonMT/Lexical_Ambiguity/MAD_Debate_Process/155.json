This is because \"\u8f6c\u52a8\" can refer to both rotating and moving, and in the context of a machine, it is possible that some parts move without necessarily rotating.\n\nAdditionally, I believe that the phrase \"\u4e00\u4e0b\" should be translated as \"a little\" rather than \"a little bit\". While both translations are technically correct, \"a little\" is a more natural and commonly used phrase in English.\n\nOverall, I believe that \"Apply some oil to lubricate the moving parts of the machine\" is a more accurate translation of the Chinese text, as it takes into account the possibility of non-rotating parts and uses a more natural English phrase.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have? Present them without reasons."
