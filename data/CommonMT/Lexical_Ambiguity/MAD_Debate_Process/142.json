                "content": "Now the third round of debate for both sides has ended.\n\nAffirmative side arguing:\nThank you for presenting your perspective again. While I understand your reasoning, I still believe that \"Qingtian\" is a more accurate translation for the term \"\u9752\u5929\" in this context.\n\nFirstly, while \"\u9752\u5929\" can be used as a metaphor for a hero or savior, it is more commonly used as a nickname or honorific title for someone who is highly respected and admired. This is supported by the fact that \"\u9752\u5929\" is often used in Chinese culture to refer to historical figures who were known for their righteousness and bravery, rather than just heroic figures in general.\n\nSecondly, while \"\u79f0\u4f5c\" can mean \"to regard as\" or \"to consider as\", it is more commonly used to mean \"to call\" or \"to name as\". In this context, it is more likely that the common people are calling this person \"Qingtian\" as a nickname or honorific title, rather than regarding them as a hero.\n\nTherefore, I still believe that \"The common people all call this person 'Qingtian'\" is the more accurate translation of the Chinese text.\n\nNegative side arguing: Thank you for your response. After considering your points, I agree that \"Qingtian\" is a more accurate translation for the term \"\u9752\u5929\" in this context.\n\nAs you mentioned, \"\u9752\u5929\" is commonly used as a nickname or honorific title for someone who is highly respected and admired, particularly for their righteousness and bravery. This is supported by the fact that the Chinese text specifically states that \"\u8001\u767e\u59d3\u90fd\u628a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4eba\u79f0\u4f5c\u9752\u5929\", which implies that the person being referred to is commonly known and respected by the general public.\n\nAdditionally, while \"\u79f0\u4f5c\" can mean \"to regard as\" or \"to consider as\", it is more commonly used to mean \"to call\" or \"to name as\". In this context, it is more likely that the common people are calling this person \"Qingtian\" as a nickname or honorific title, rather than regarding them as a hero.\n\nTherefore, I agree that \"The common people all call this person 'Qingtian'\" is the more accurate translation of the Chinese text.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate. If so, please summarize your reasons for supporting affirmative/negative side and give the final translation that you think is correct, and the debate will conclude. If not, the debate will continue to the next round. Now please output your answer in json format, with the format as follows: {\"Whether there is a preference\": \"Yes or No\", \"Supported Side\": \"Affirmative or Negative\", \"Reason\": \"\", \"Correct Translation\": \"\"}"
